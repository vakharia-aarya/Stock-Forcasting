# Stock Forecasting Using SVM

Support vector machines (SVM) are powerful tool used in various machine learning applications. One such application is classification on time-series data. 

Stock forecasting is one such application, that can be solved by such an algorithm. This project overcomes the problem by using historical data to predict future values of the stock price. 

In this project, we use support vector regressor with 3 different kernels, namely linear, polynomial of degree 2 and radial basis function (rbf) to predict future stock prices. 

**Output:**

The final comparison between all three kernel show us that the rbf kernel performs the best on the overall data, giving us a accuracy score of 87%.
